        "\n# Export epochs to Pandas DataFrame\n\n\nIn this example the pandas exporter will be used to produce a DataFrame\nobject. After exploring some basic features a split-apply-combine\nwork flow will be conducted to examine the latencies of the response\nmaxima across epochs and conditions.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Equivalent methods are available for raw and evoked data objects.</p></div>\n\nMore information and additional introductory materials can be found at the\npandas doc sites: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/\n\nShort Pandas Primer\n-------------------\n\nPandas Data Frames\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nA data frame can be thought of as a combination of matrix, list and dict:\nIt knows about linear algebra and element-wise operations but is size mutable\nand allows for labeled access to its data. In addition, the pandas data frame\nclass provides many useful methods for restructuring, reshaping and visualizing\ndata. As most methods return data frame instances, operations can be chained\nwith ease; this allows to write efficient one-liners. Technically a DataFrame\ncan be seen as a high-level container for numpy arrays and hence switching\nback and forth between numpy arrays and DataFrames is very easy.\nTaken together, these features qualify data frames for inter operation with\ndatabases and for interactive data exploration / analysis.\nAdditionally, pandas interfaces with the R statistical computing language that\ncovers a huge amount of statistical functionality.\n\nExport Options\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe pandas exporter comes with a few options worth being commented.\n\nPandas DataFrame objects use a so called hierarchical index. This can be\nthought of as an array of unique tuples, in our case, representing the higher\ndimensional MEG data in a 2D data table. The column names are the channel names\nfrom the epoch object. The channels can be accessed like entries of a\ndictionary::\n\n    >>> df['MEG 2333']\n\nEpochs and time slices can be accessed with the .loc method::\n\n    >>> epochs_df.loc[(1, 2), 'MEG 2333']\n\nHowever, it is also possible to include this index as regular categorial data\ncolumns which yields a long table format typically used for repeated measure\ndesigns. To take control of this feature, on export, you can specify which\nof the three dimensions 'condition', 'epoch' and 'time' is passed to the Pandas\nindex using the index parameter. Note that this decision is revertible any\ntime, as demonstrated below.\n\nSimilarly, for convenience, it is possible to scale the times, e.g. from\nseconds to milliseconds.\n\nSome Instance Methods\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMost numpy methods and many ufuncs can be found as instance methods, e.g.\nmean, median, var, std, mul, , max, argmax etc.\nBelow an incomplete listing of additional useful data frame instance methods:\n\napply : apply function to data.\n    Any kind of custom function can be applied to the data. In combination with\n    lambda this can be very useful.\ndescribe : quickly generate summary stats\n    Very useful for exploring data.\ngroupby : generate subgroups and initialize a 'split-apply-combine' operation.\n    Creates a group object. Subsequently, methods like apply, agg, or transform\n    can be used to manipulate the underlying data separately but\n    simultaneously. Finally, reset_index can be used to combine the results\n    back into a data frame.\nplot : wrapper around plt.plot\n    However it comes with some special options. For examples see below.\nshape : shape attribute\n    gets the dimensions of the data frame.\nvalues :\n    return underlying numpy array.\nto_records :\n    export data as numpy record array.\nto_dict :\n    export data as dict of arrays.\n\n"
